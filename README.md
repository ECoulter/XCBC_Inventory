Script(s) to call 'roll' on XCBC cluster with 
basic installation. 

Use at your own risk! 

Currently: Asks Rocks for list of hosts
           
           Runs inventory on those, asks for hostname, cpuinfo, and memory
 
           Compares Rocks list of hosts to those returned from inventory

Could be improved: 

 make submit.sh clearer?

 submit.sh cmdline options

  - take queue as an option as well?

 why so slow through the queue? 

 make output format nicer?
